## Issue: Could not sign-in. There was a problem connecting to play.google.com

### Preface: 
##### This issue will prevent you from signing into Play Store and effectively prevent the function of MindTheGapps/OpenGapps. This issue may usually occur after updating. Known cases have occured after updating from a non Google Apps WSA build to a Google Apps build

## Solution:

### Internet is working on other app in WSA?

######  Step 1: 
Turn WSA off through the Windows Subsystem For Android Settings app

###### Step 2:
Open up your favourite VPN and connect to a server. You can use any VPN for this. VPNs recommended: ProtonVPN, AtlasVPN

###### Step 3:
Turn on WSA and open Play Store.

###### Step 4:
You should now be able to log in to Google Play and hopefully download apps!
