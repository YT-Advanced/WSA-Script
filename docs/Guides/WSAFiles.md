# Sideloading using the Files app

#### Starting with WSA version 2305, you can sideload APK files using the Files app. This guide will show you how.

> **NOTE:**
> This guide is only applicable for WSA versions 2305 and above. If you're using an older version, you will need to use [ADB](ADB-Sideloading.md) or one of the [listed APK installers](Sideloading.md).

## Setup

***1. Open the Windows Subsystem for Android app, go to Advanced Settings and enable share user folders found under experimental features. Then select the folder that you would like to share by clicking on "Change folder".***

> **NOTE:**
> If you're facing problems, try disabling `Block installation of malicious apps` in the WSA app.

## After installation 

#### Once installed, you can launch the sideloaded app from the Start Menu.



#### If you want to install bundle files, such as .apkm or .xapk, you can install [SAI](https://apkpure.com/split-apks-installer-sai/com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install bundle files, as well as regular APKs.
