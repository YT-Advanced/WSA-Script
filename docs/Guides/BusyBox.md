## Guide: How to install BusyBox

### Preface:
##### Since Magisk has BusyBox built-in already, this proceedure is very simple

## Process

### Step 1: 
Using an Android browser downloaded though the Play Store/sideloaded into WSA, download the following [Magisk Module](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/BuiltIn-BusyBox) to install and symlink BusyBox with its applets to the Magisk built-in busybox binary. No need to do it manually or to get a Custom Build.

### Step 2: 
Through Magisk Manager, install the Magisk module .zip file

### Step 3 (Optional):
You can then test if BusyBox is working by either using a Root Checker:

or by using ADB Shell and:

`` adb shell ``
``su``
``busybox | head -1``
