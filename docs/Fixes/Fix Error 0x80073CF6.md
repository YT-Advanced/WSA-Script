## Issue: </br> Error 0x80073CF6 when "Run.bat" is executed to install Windows Subystem for Android (WSA)
### Preface:
##### This issue can arise due to many factors that is preventing the app from being registered. Although there is no definite solution, we can try these steps to try to fix the problem
##### This installation issue may also arise in systems that are using Modified Windows OSes such as ReviOS, Tiny10/11, etc. This is due to the fact that these OSes have been modified to remove certain features that are deemed unnecessary. This may cause issues with the installation of WSA.

## Prequisite Steps:

**1. Ensure the partition/drive you are installing from is NTFS**

**2. Redownload WSA Build .zip (sometime the files can be corrupted during download and extraction)**

**3. If you have installed WSA prior, make sure that it has been uninstalled and delete all folders containing "WindowsSubsystemForAndroid" from the following directories/paths and the subdirectories within:** 

   - *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\AppRepository*
   
   - *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsApps*
   
   - *%localappdata\ProgramData\Packages*

<br>

**4. Restart your Computer**

If the issue has been fixed, then there is no need to follow through the rest of the guide.
However, if you have the same issue, it is vital that you obtain the logs and try to decipher what is causing the error

To obtain the logs (admin privilege required):

1. Open a PowerShell window and change working directory to your Windows Subsystem For Androidâ„¢ directory.
    
2. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should fail with an ActivityID, which is a UUID required for the next step.
      ```Powershell
       Add-AppxPackage -ForceApplicationShutdown -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Register .\AppxManifest.xml
      ```   
3. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should print the log of the failed operation.
      
      ```Powershell
       Get-AppPackageLog -ActivityID <UUID>
      ```
