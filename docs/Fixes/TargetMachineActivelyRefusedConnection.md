## Issue: </br> Error: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it (10061)
### Preface:
##### This issue occurs when you are either using a sideloading application such as [WSA-Sideloader](https://github.com/infinitepower18/WSA-Sideloader) or [WSAPacman](https://github.com/alesimula/wsa_pacman), or when you try to connect to a device using ``adb.exe`` via [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools). This issue arises due to an issue with the inability of Hyper V to reserve port 58526 causing the issue, as seen below.

## Solution

This is a [bug](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/issues/136) with the subsystem itself, restarting the PC will usually fix it.

If you still get this error, try these steps:

1. Make sure WSA is turned off and disable WSA autostart in Task Manager ---> Startup Apps before proceeding

2. Disable Hyper-V using the command ``dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V`` and reboot your PC

3. Reserve port 58526 so Hyper-V doesn't reserve it back using the command `netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange protocol=tcp startport=58526 numberofports=1`

4. Re-enable Hyper-V using the command `dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V /All` and reboot your PC

Your issue should be fixed now!
